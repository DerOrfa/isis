Description: The ISIS package provides a general I/O framework for neuroimaging
 data.  Being started with fMRI data, it can handle several established data
 formats, like Nifti, Analyze, DICOM and vista. A first application based on this
 project is a data converter that allows an easy and unified handling of fMRI
 data from various MRI scanners. 
 .
 This Package provides a number of utilities to handle neuroimaging data. This includes
 a multi-format converter and tools to inspect the image meta data.
