Package: isisio0-dicom
Section: science
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libisiscore0
Description: The ISIS package provides a general I/O framework for neuroimaging
 data.  Being started with fMRI data, it can handle several established data
 formats, like Nifti, Analyze, DICOM and vista. A first application based on this
 project is a data converter that allows an easy and unified handling of fMRI
 data from various MRI scanners. 
 .
 This Package provides the ISIS I/O plugins for the DICOM support.
